\section*{SYNOPSIS}
	\justify
	The telecommunication always tries to reach the best performances, the reliability and the efficiency with the lowest possible costs. In this domain, antennas establish a basic element allowing the transmission of the electromagnetic waves in free space. We find several types of antennas which different by cuts, geometrical shape, capacity of transmission. The most serious limitations of the microstrip antenna is its narrow band, which is typically of the order of some percents 1-5 \%. However, the new generation of the communication, the mobile or satellite communication, provokes considerable changes in patches antennas, from which the various modern applications require a functioning in wideband.
	This  project will design and analyze a rectangular Microstrip patch antenna by using the software HFSS.Microstrip antennas have a profile which relays at the needs of new technology, such as a low profile, a flat configuration and a better gain. The simple configuration of the rectangular microstrip antenna presents generally a narrow band. The project will take effort to enhance gain and bandwidth with inclusion of symmetrical shape slots placed on the patch surface.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
    \subsection{Energy, Economy Environment Aspect:}\label{sub:Energy, Economy Environment Aspect:}
       Multiband freq. band at 2GHz,3.06GHz  3.84GHz  .Slot shapes embedded along the four diagonal directions on the patch radiators gives circularly polarization. The proposed patch antenna will be designed using above designing parameters and the responses obtained using HFSS simulation software.
    \subsection{Project Planning:}\label{sub:Project Planning:}

    \subsection{Cost estimation:}\label{sub:Cost estimation:}
      The costing includes two dimensions
      a.  designing
      b. fabrication
      The designing includes more labour than monetary factors. Once the design is ready the antenna will be ready very early.  The fabrication of antenna in size is very small.  It is like two credit cards.
      The approximate cost will be near about 4 to 5 K.
