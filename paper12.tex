			 Summary & This paper presents the result for antenna factor of microstrip patch antenna when used as electromagnetic interference (EMI) sensor. Antenna factor is an important parameter of a sensor used for EMI measurements. The microstrip antenna has found wide application as transmit and receive antenna in modern microwave systems. In this paper, a new application of microstrip antenna as EMI sensor is presented. The result for antenna factor versus frequency of a microstrip patch antenna is presented using commercial software CST Microwave Studio. Also the experimental results for a prototype antenna are presented and compared with the simulated result.\\
