			 Publishing details & Different feeding techniques of microstrip patch antennas with different spiral defected ground structures are presented in this paper. The investigated structures illustrate some merits in designing multi-electromagnetic band-gap structures by adjusting the capacitance and changing the inductance through varying the width and length of spiral defected ground structure.\\
