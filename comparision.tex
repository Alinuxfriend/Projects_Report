			     Bandwidth Improvements Using Ground Slots for Compact UWB Microstrip-fed Antennas & The hexagonal slot provides the largest impedance bandwidth of 3.1-16.3 GHz for S11 < ยก10 dB, with an average gain of about 2.8 dBi and an average efficiency of about 88\% \\ \hline
			     
			     Development of a practical ultra- wideband antenna with planar circuit integration possibilities & This antenna can also be operated at 2.478 GHz as it provides dual band operation. At 2.478 GHz the values of Return loss and bandwidth are -30.218dB and 33.1 MHz respectively \\ \hline
			     
			     Wide band high efficiency printed loop antenna design for wireless communication systems & A compact, 31mm x 21mm low profile planar ultra-wide band patch antenna was introduced. The antenna was ex-cited using a rectangular edge-feed microstrip feed line. The impedance bandwidth of the antenna is about 11 GHz (3.0-14GHz), which exceeds the FCC UBW requirement. \\ \hline
			     
			     Design of reconfigurable slot antenna & Besides exhibiting a 10-dB bandwidth of 172\% with 13.06:1 ratio bandwidth, a 14-dB bandwidth (low return loss) of 79\% is also demonstrated in the higher UWB operating bands for outdoor propagation.\\ \hline
			     
			     Design of band notched UWB patch antenna with circular slot  & The patch antenna ring ultrawide-bandwidth radiating between 2.5GHz and 9.4GHz in order to achieve the
			     operation Bluetooth / ISM, 2.5/3.5 GHz and 5.2/5.7 GHz WiMAX WLAN. \\ \hline 
			     
			     Microstrip Antenna gain enhancement using left-handed metamaterial structure & The resonant frequency of the antenna is 1.99 GHz.
			     return loss with frequency of antenna is found to be -30.33 dB at resonant frequency 1.99 GHz. \\ \hline
			     
			     Single-feed dual-frequency rectangular microstrip antenna with square slot &  At 2GHz the verified and tested result on RadiationEfficiency=91.99\%, Directivity=5.4dBi,Directive gain=4.98dBi \\ \hline
