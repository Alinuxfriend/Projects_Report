			 Summary & This paper describes the effect of temperature variation on microstrip patch antenna for different substrate materials. Eight materials are chosen as substrate and the effect of temperature variation is studied on each substrate material. A technique of temperature compensation has also been developed with substrate height variation. It is also seen that the change in resonance frequency due to variation of temperature can be compensated by varying the height of the substrate. The proposed antenna is designed and simulated by using HFSS software.\\
