			 Publishing details & The ground element of the proposed antenna is taken in the form of defected ground structure. The antenna is fed by a microstrip feeding technique and printed on a dielectric Fr4 substrate of dimension (30mm X 32 mm) permittivity Îµr =4.4 and height h = 1.59 mm. The optimization on the microstrip has been done to accomplish an -10 dB return loss criterion. Design parameters like substrate variation, feed size and defected ground plane which affect the performance of the antenna in terms of its frequency domain and time domain characteristics are investigated.\\
