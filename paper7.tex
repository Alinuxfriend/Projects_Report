			 Summary & A band notched ultra-wideband (UWB) patch antenna is presented with its circuit modeling. The rectangular patch antenna is designed on dielectric substrate and fed with 50 Ω microstrip by optimizing the width of partial ground, the width of the feed line to operate in UWB. This antenna consists of a radiating element with a strip, and a partial ground plane and feeding line has been demonstrated. With the design, the return loss is lower than 10 dB in 3.1-10.6 GHz frequency range and show the band-notch characteristic in the UWB band to avoid interferences, which is caused by WLAN (5.15–5.825 GHz) and WiMax (5.25–5.85 GHz) systems. \\
