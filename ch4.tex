     Microstrip patch antennas are mostly used in wireless applications due to their low profile Structure. Therefore they are extremely compatible for embedded antennas in handheld Wireless devices such as cellular phones, pagers etc.
     
     
      Some of the principal advantages are given below:
        \begin{itemize}
          	\item Light weight and less volume.
          	\item Low fabrication cost, therefore can be manufactured in large quantities.
           	\item Supports both, linear as well as circular polarization.
           	\item Low profile planar configuration which can be easily made conformal to host surface.
           	\item Can be easily integrated with microwave integrated circuits (MICs).
           	\item Capable of dual and triple frequency operations.
           	\item Mechanically robust when mounted on rough surfaces.
         \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Application}
         \begin{itemize}
          	\item Satellite communications
           	\item Microwave communications
           	\item Cell phone antennas
           	\item GPS antennas

         \end{itemize}
