			 Summary & A small microstip-fed monopole antenna, which consists of a rectangular patch and a truncated ground plane, is presented for ultra wideband application. The proposed antenna is designed to operate over 3.1 to 11 GHz for 11 10 dB. Good return loss and radiation pattern characteristics are obtained in the frequency band of interest.\\
