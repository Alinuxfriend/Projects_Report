			 Summary & The printed antenna is one of the best antenna structures, due to its low cost and compact design. In this paper a new approach to improve the radiation effectiveness and the performance of antennas by miniaturization of the size. Indeed, we have studied the performance of ultra wideband antenna which consists of a ring-shaped patch. This study was made for the whole frequency band of UWB ranging from 2.5GHz to 9.4GHz and the geometry of the antenna and the results were obtained using the simulation software. \\
