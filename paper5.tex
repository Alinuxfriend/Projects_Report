			 Summary & A two-port rectangular microstrip patch antenna for dual frequency operation is investigated in this paper. Simple microstrip line feed has been used to feed the antenna. Quarter wavelength transformer is used for impedance matching. For the conventional dual feed dual frequency antenna the isolation between the two ports is obtained as 30 dB. An Improvement in isolation performance has been achieved by the introduction of defected microstrip structure which acts as band stop filters and thereby increases isolation between the two ports.\\
